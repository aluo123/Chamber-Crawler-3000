This is a classic Rogue-like game with a ASCII display. Running it without command line arguments creates a map with randomly 
generated enemies. Running it with a command line argument uses the pregenerated map from that file. Built in floor is 
"cc3kfloor.txt". To move, enter one of the 8 directions: "no nw we sw so se ea ne". To attack, enter "a" followed by a direction.
To use a potion, enter "u" followed by a direction. To pick up gold, walk over it. The goal is to try and get the most gold
at the end of the level.
